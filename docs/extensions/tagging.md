title: Tag downloaded files using Mutagen
---

Add tags to MP3/MP4/OGG files after download.

By default, this extension will:
   - Remove existing tags
   - Write the Title tag, stripping the album from the beginning of the Title if necessary
   - Write the Album tag
   - Write the Artist tag (with the same string as the Album tag)
   - Write the Genre (to "Podcast", configurable)
   - Write the publish date

Also available are writing the Subtitle tag and the Comments tag (both with the
subtitle field), but the subtitle is often so long that it may cause problems with
certain audio players, such as Rockbox players. These are disabled by default.

This extension can optionally embed coverart - art can either be the channel artwork
or episode-specific artwork already embedded in the file. By default, the episode
artwork will be preferred if it is present - if not, the channel artwork will be used.

Note that episode-specific artwork in MP4 files is currently not implemented.

The artwork can optionally be normalized to the desired parameters - size and file type.
By default, it will write Baseline (Non-Progressive) JPEGs with the larger side scaled to 500px and the aspect ratio maintained.

This extension can optionally remove all tags instead of doing any of the above.
This is disabled by default.

## Dependencies

This extension requires python modules `mutagen` and `pillow`.
