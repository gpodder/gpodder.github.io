gPodder is now available as:
 - a macOS Application (Download from [Here](../index.md#get-it)).
 - Homebrew Cask

If you're not already using Homebrew, the macOS application download is the recommended way to install gPodder.

Simply double-click to unzip the application, then copy `gPodder.app` to your `/Applications` folder.

Otherwise, using Homebrew, run `brew cask install gpodder; xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/gPodder.app`

Debugging gPodder on macOS
-------------------------

1. Ensure gPodder isn't running
2. Start the Terminal application
3. enter `/Applications/gPodder.app/Contents/MacOS/gpodder -v` and press the Enter key

Youâ€™ll see all the debug information you want.
