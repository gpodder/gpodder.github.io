title: Extensions
---

Extensions are gPodder's mechanism for adding optional features and allowing easy customizability. Some extensions are already activated by default if you are running a specific environment (e.g. Ubuntu Unity support in gPodder 3 is implemented as an extension).

Sometimes the ordering of extensions is important. gPodder parses the filenames of extensions for a prefix, like "50_". When it finds a prefix like this, it sorts according to said prefix, with lower numbers being run earlier. If two extensions have the same priority, they will be sorted in alphabetical order according to their base name. If multiple instances of an extension are desired, the base name must be different, not just the prefix.

Extensions found within the user extension directory with the same base name (regardless of whether the prefix matches, or is present at all) override extensions provided with gPodder in the system directory.

Note that this allows for easy changing of extension priorities. Simply create a symbolic link in the user extension directory which points to the existing extension in the gPodder system directory and name it the same except with a different numerical prefix. This works even if the extension in the system directory does not have a prefix at all!

As an example, if you wished to change "20_audio_converter.py" to "50_audio_converter.py", all you would need to do is, in the user extension directory, make a symbolic link called "50_audio_converter.py" which points to the original extension in the system directory.

This would also work if you wished to create multiple instances of the same extension. For example, if you wished to have a "command_on_download.py" which runs early and one which runs late, you could create two symlinks in the user extension directory, "10_command_on_download.py" and "80_command_on_download_late.py".

Extensions with no priority prefix automatically get priority 99. Therefore if an extension needs to run later than everything, use a value of 100 or greater.

### How To Write Your Own Extension

Extensions are a great way to customize your gPodder workflow: you'll be able to customize the UI, rename, modify or trigger
external programs when episodes are downloaded, etc..


#### Getting started

1. Extensions are loaded from the `Extensions` folder in the [gPodder Home Folder](#default-gpodder-home-folder).
The folder doesn't exist by default, so create it.

2. An example extension is available [here](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/examples/hello_world.py).
   Copy it to **GPODDER\_HOME/Extensions** and restart gPodder.

3. Extensions are activated from the **Extensions** pane of the **Preferences** dialog.
   Activate the **Hello World Extension** to get a item in the **Extras** menu called
   **Say Hello**.

4. Modify the `Message`, restart gPodder and see the updated notification when you click **Say Hello**.


#### Doing something useful

Maybe an existing extension does something similar to what you want
([rename after download](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/rename_download.py),
[tagging](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/tagging.py),
[run a command after download](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/share/gpodder/extensions/command_on_download.py), ...).
Find inspiration in [its source code](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/tree/master/share/gpodder/extensions).

To see how an extension is loaded and every available callback, take a look at [extensions.py](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/src/gpodder/extensions.py);
every method annotated with `@call_extensions` can be overriden in your extension. Check its parameters and return type.

gPodder's [model](https://github.com/gpodder/gpodder/blob/master/src/gpodder/model.py#L197) is quite straightforward.
Given an episode `e`:
 - get its title via `e.title`, its url via `e.url`
 - get the channel's subscription url via `e.channel.url`.


#### Debugging your extension

If your extension doesn't appear in the list,
be sure:
  - that its `__only_for__` or `__disable_in__` instructions (if any) apply to your system.
  - to run gpodder in debug mode (`gpodder -v`, [Windows](https://gpodder.github.io/docs/windows.html#debugging-gpodder-on-windows))
  and check that it's found and there isn't any error message:
```
[gpodder.extensions] DEBUG: Found extension "hello_world" in .../Extensions/hello_world.py
[gpodder.extensions] INFO: Module loaded: .../Extensions/hello_world.py

```

You should run `gpodder -v` anyway, because any log with lower priority than `logger.warn` is suppressed by default.

Feel free to ask for advice in the [mailing list](mailing-list) or as github issues:
we are always pleased to see you customize gPodder to your own needs.

Also, you may have to modify code in gPodder itself to achieve a particular goal.
This is OK: no need to recompile anything: just edit the **.py** and restart...
